# COMPANIES JSON Generator

Generates arbitrary amount of fake companies JSON information, useful for tests where big datasets are required (e.x: 1GB+ fake data).

_It generates a Million of random fake companies data by default in less than 10 seconds!_

This number was chosen to avoid having RAM problems (getting out of RAM) in a 16GB RAM machine and get the result really fast

## Example usage for Unix based Operating Systems (Linux-based, Mac, etc):

```
â–¶ go run src/main.go > /tmp/companies.json
```
